/*  Functions of Google Places API:
1. Provide place search results from different types of users queries, such as text input, nearby locations, and ambiguous or categorical user queries.
2. Add high-quality photos to locations served by your application.
3. Refine the type of details returned about a place, such as operating hours, a summary, user reviews, and a photo.

Many Google Maps Platform APIs support place IDs, where the place ID uniquely identifies a place in the Google Places database and on Google Maps.
There are many ways to obtain a place ID, including from the Places API, but also from the Geocoding API, Routes API, and Address Validation API.

Layman Terms: Using the place ID, we can get the details of a place, such as the name, address, and phone number. 
We can also get the place's location, opening hours, and photos from the Google Places API.

Using the new Places API:

1. Place Details
A place ID uniquely identifies a place in the Google Places database and on Google Maps. 
With a place ID, you can request details about a particular establishment or point of interest by initiating a Place Details (New) request. 
A Place Details (New) request returns comprehensive information about the indicated place such as its complete address, phone number, user rating, and reviews.

There are many ways to obtain a place ID. You can use:

Text Search (New) - returns information about a set of places based on a string â€” for example "pizza in New York" or "shoe stores near Ottawa" or "123 Main Street".
The service responds with a list of places matching the text string and any location bias that has been set.
